Later we can do a more formal version, for now we can just use this to right notes on ongoing bugs, trouble points, etc

Right now, there should be a bunch of empty methods to fill in ourselves based on the actual implementation

We should also try to maintain sort of documention here too

Relatively Unimportant Files:
Scratch.py - A trash file I like to use as the code equivalent of scratch paper for troubleshooting or seeing how the code actually works
paths_constants.py - A file to store constants in one place
helper.py - A file for helper functions

Important Files:
embeddings and decoder.py - Where we create the actual model
model.py - A place to put embeddings and decoder together
train.py -
