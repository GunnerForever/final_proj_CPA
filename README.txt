Later we can do a more formal version, for now we can just use this to right notes on ongoing bugs, trouble points, etc

Right now, there should be a bunch of empty methods to fill in ourselves based on the actual implementation

We should also try to maintain sort of documention here too
- While I am just copying the file structure of the implementation, I did skip a few files assuming we are doing a simplified implementation and added a preprocess.py

Scratch.py - A trash file I like to use as the code equivalent of scratch paper for troubleshooting or seeing how the code actually works
